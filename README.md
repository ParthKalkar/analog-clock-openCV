# analog-clock-openCV
In this project, I will  make an analog clock using openCV. 

**Note:** we will use the concepts of Trigonometry and Computer Vision along with the capabilities of python to develop a analog running watch.

## Algorithm
1. Start the project by including dependencies.
2. Initialize the constants Radius, Canvas size, Colors.
3. Start drawing the watch
4. Develop function to get start and end positions of tick marks on watch.
5. Draw tick marks.
6. Develop function for movements and drawing of hands.
7. Draw hands.
8. Move hands to time angles.
9. Show the clock in loop.

## Stack
1. python3 
2. numpy 
3. opencv 

## Run
1. Download the files in a directory 
2. Open terminal in that directory 
3. Run the command `$ python3 analog_clock.py`

## Output
